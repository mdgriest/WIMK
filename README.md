## Get out of the kitchen!

We designed **WIMK** to help you avoid buying groceries you already have or forgetting those you don't. That being said, the application is useful for keeping track of anything, not just food! Try using it to maintain tabs on things you don't buy often, like salt for your sidewalk, grease for your bike chain, or cleaning supplies.

# That's all, have fun!
