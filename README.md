### Adding to your Inventory

From the inventory screen, click the  **Add Item** to add a new item to your inventory

You will see this screen:

<img src="newItemScreenShot.png" alt="Inventory Screen" style="width:250px;" border="4"/>

Here, you can choose a name and color for your new item, and drag to set the quantity.

In **WIMK**, quantity is relative to you. Set the quantity based on how much you typically keep around, and you'll never have to guess!

### Updating your inventory

You can update the name, color, and name of any item in your inventory simply by clicking on it in the inventory screen. This is also how you delete items that you no longer want to keep track of.

---

## Get out of the kitchen!

We designed **WIMK** to help you avoid buying groceries you already have or forgetting those you don't. That being said, the application is useful for keeping track of anything, not just food! Try using it to maintain tabs on things you don't buy often, like salt for your sidewalk, grease for your bike chain, or cleaning supplies.

# That's all, have fun!
